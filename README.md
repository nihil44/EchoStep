# EchoStep

**EchoStep** is a short 2D platformer prototype built in Unity.  
It was created as part of my learning journey in game development.

This project explores simple platforming mechanics and atmospheric minimalism.  
The goal is to deliver a sense of **loneliness**, **freedom**, and **discovery**  
— one echoing step at a time.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Move with `A` / `D` or `←` / `→`
- Jump with `Space`
- Reach the end of the level by navigating platforms

The level is intentionally minimal and symbolic, emphasizing feeling over mechanics.

---

## 💡 Features

- Basic 2D movement & jumping
- Ground detection & smooth physics
- Simple camera follow logic
- A handcrafted level designed for clarity and flow
- Fully working WebGL build published on [itch.io](https://nihildev.itch.io/echostep)

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Unity** (Version: 2023.x LTS)
- C#
- Unity’s built-in 2D tools

---

## 📁 Project Structure Highlights

- `Scripts/` – Player movement & camera logic
- `Scenes/` – Main game scene
- `Physics Materials/` – Custom physics settings (e.g. frictionless ground)
- `Prefabs/` – Modular game elements

---

## 🚀 Status

EchoStep is a **prototype**, not a complete game.  
Its purpose is to reflect an early stage in my development journey as a solo game developer.

---

## 📌 Future Plans

- Add background parallax & polish
- Add atmospheric music
- Maybe develop into a short story-based platformer
